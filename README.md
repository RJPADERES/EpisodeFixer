# EpisodeFixer
Part of my Useless Application Series — this tool automatically renames messy downloaded episode files into clean, organized titles Jellyfin can actually read. No more random dots, tags, or broken episode names. It’s a simple fix born from frustration — because apparently, media servers still can’t get filenames right.
