# EpisodeFixer
Part of my Useless Application Series — this tool automatically renames messy downloaded episode files into clean, organized titles Jellyfin can actually read. No more random dots, tags, or broken episode names. It’s a simple fix born from frustration — because apparently, media servers still can’t get filenames right.

If you’ve ever dealt with filenames like  
`Show.Name.S02E05.1080p.WEBRip.GROUP`  
and watched Jellyfin mislabel or completely ignore them, this app is for you.  

### 🚀 Features
- Automatically detects and renames downloaded TV episodes.  
- Cleans up weird release tags and junk text.  
- Makes filenames readable and Jellyfin-friendly.  
- Lightweight, fast, and extremely opinionated.  

### ⚙️ Why I Made This
Because I got tired of Jellyfin refusing to properly identify my episodes — and because I enjoy making “useless” apps that solve very specific problems.  

### 🧠 How It Works
Drop your messy episode folder into the app, let it analyze and rename files, and you’re done. No setup, no database, no nonsense.

A collection of projects that sound useless… until you realize you actually need them.  

### 🧾 License
MIT License – use it, break it, or improve it. Just don’t blame me if Jellyfin still gets confused.
